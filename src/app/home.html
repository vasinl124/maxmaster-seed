<h1>Hello, {{ name }}!!!</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    Try to push the button before angular2 will be loaded.
    Preboot will catch the "click" event and replay it later.
  </p>
  <div>
    <button id="check-preboot" (click)="onCheckPreboot()">Check "Preboot"</button>
    <span id="message-preboot" *ngIf="messagePreboot">{{ messagePreboot }}</span>
  </div>

    For big applications itâ€™s not efficient to put all code into a single file,
    especially if some blocks of code are only required under some circumstances. It's much better
    to split your application into several parts and load them only if they're needed.
    That's where <b>Webpack's Code Spliting</b> is shinning.
    You just need to use its <b>require.ensure()</b> function to specify split points in your
    application and webpack will do the rest for you.
    Read more about code splitting and how to use it <a href="https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html">here</a>.
    If you push the next button, the greeting message will be lazy loaded.

  <div>
    <button id="check-lazyloading" (click)="onCheckLazyLoading()">Check "Lazy Loading"</button>
    <span id="message-lazyloading" *ngIf="messageLazyLoading">{{ messageLazyLoading }}</span>
  </div>
